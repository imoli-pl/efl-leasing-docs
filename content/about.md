EFL Leasing helps you add leasing and financing as a payment method to your ecommerce store or custom application.  
This documentation is organised around two main building blocks:

- **PHP SDK** – a PHP SDK for custom integrations and backend services
- **Ecommerce integrations** – ready‑made modules for popular shop platforms

Use the PHP SDK when you build your own integration or connect multiple sales channels. Use the ecommerce plugins when you just want to enable EFL Leasing quickly in a specific platform without touching the code.

## Where to start

If this is your first time with EFL Leasing, start by deciding how you want to integrate:

- **Use the PHP SDK** when you build your own backend integration or connect multiple sales channels.
- **Use an ecommerce integration** when you want a ready‑made plugin for PrestaShop, WooCommerce or Shoper.

In both cases you can configure test credentials, verify the flow in a sandbox environment and then go live with production credentials.

## Ecommerce integrations

You can integrate EFL Leasing with your store using one of the official plugins:

- **PrestaShop module** – installable from your PrestaShop back office, adds EFL Leasing as a payment option and on product pages. [Read the PrestaShop guide](/prestashop).
- **WordPress / WooCommerce plugin** – ready‑to‑use plugin for WooCommerce‑based shops. [Read the WooCommerce guide](/wordpress).
- **Shoper application** – integration for Shoper‑based stores that exposes EFL Leasing in checkout and product views. [Read the Shoper guide](/shoper).

All ecommerce integrations are built on top of the same **EFL Leasing PHP SDK**. This means:

- the leasing decision and application flow is consistent across platforms
- you can mix plugins with custom SDK integrations in other channels
- monitoring and logging follow the same patterns in your backend systems
